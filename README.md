This is a simple Employee Database App built with Android Studio using Kotlin. 
The app allows users to add employees with their name and position, save them into a local Room database, and view the list of all added employees in a user-friendly interface. 
It uses Android Jetpack components such as Room for persistent data storage and LiveData for observing changes in the database. 
The UI is designed with modern Material Design principles, and supports background color customization for a fresh look. 
The project also includes support for custom launcher icons to give your app a professional appearance. 
This project is perfect for beginners who want to learn CRUD operations with Room in Android,
MVVM architecture basics, and building responsive layouts with XML.
Feel free to fork, modify, and use this as a starting point for more advanced employee or record-keeping apps.
